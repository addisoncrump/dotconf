these example rely on dot.conf and libpool being already installed
on your system - otherwise you'll probably have to fiddle around
with the makefiles.

to build, simply cd into the example's directory and type
$ make

for everything that remains unclear you may consult the documentation,
or contact me at    <lukas@azzit.de>


the duplicates/ example has been provided by Joost Remijn to show what you can
do with his DUPLICATE_OPTION_NAME feature. You need at least dot.conf 1.0.9 to
use it.


enjoy.
