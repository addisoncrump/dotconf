dot.conf feature descriptions
=============================

Builtin Commands
================
    dot.conf natively has the ability to 'Include' additional configuration
    files that can be found
      - relative to the current working directory,
      - relative to some include path, which can be set using the option
    	  'IncludePath' or the environment variable DC_INCLUDEPATH
      - at a fully qualified position (starting with a / )

Here Documents
===============
    dot.conf also supports so-called 'here-documents' as known from
    the shell or from PERL. this feature can be used for ARG_STR type
    options. a here-document is initiated by <<DELIMITER and finished by
    DELIMITER itself on a line. The last newline is stripped of the
    resulting string.

Environment variable Substitution
=================================
   dot.conf supports substitution of environment variables including
   default substitution, if the env-var is not set.
   Substitution goes like this: ${NAME:-default}
